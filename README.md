Receiver
========

Dependencies
------------

You need a Linux distribution with Pulseaudio and some other stuff. Probably yours works.

Setting up
----------

1. Get `receiver/receive.sh`
2. Possibly you need to make it executable: `chmod 755 receive.sh`
3. Run it: `./receive.sh`

It works if it start repeatedly downloading thoughts from the server and playing them. It only plays single thought once, so you get one sound bite in the beginning and then new ones if the transmitter is transmitting.
